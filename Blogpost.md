Alfred App Workflow for op5 Monitor
===================================

If you use a Mac, you probably already know and use ([Alfred](http://alfredapp.com)). For those who don't know Alfred yet, Alfred is a productivity app for Mac OS X. It is pretty much a replacement for OSX's spotlight, with a ton of extra features, such as advanced web searches, copy&paste buffer management and history, contacts integration and iTunes control. But the really amazing feature comes with the Powerpack: Workflows! With workflows you have some pre-defined triggers, input actions etc. to build your own mini-app inside Alfred. This way, just to name one example you can bring up the Alfred prompt, type "de" to launch the "german to english translator" workflow, then type some word after it and immediately the list of possible translations is shown. The ease of creating workflows and the power they have have motivated many people to create workflows to automate many things and boost your productivity. You can find workflows for everything in the ([Alfred community forum](http://www.alfredforum.com)).

Recently op5 Monitor has been released in version 6.3 and one of the improvements it got is extending the functionality of it's Web Services API. This finally made the development of an Alfred App workflow possible.
